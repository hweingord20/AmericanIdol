# Introduction

American Idol is a reality TV show where aspiring singers compete for the winning title. Once the contestants go through the final round of auditions, the they perform in front of a panel of judges and a live audience. Overall, we want to analyze what factors are correlated with winners/finalists and what contributes to the success of the show. We decided on this topic because we both grew up watching American Idol and are interested in the statistics in the background. Through our data analysis, we will examine the following questions:

* What's the general trend in the viewership over the seasons?
* Which audition cities produced the most contestants across the seasons?
* Are younger contestants more likely to be make it to the final rounds than older ones?
* Are certain judges associated with higher-rated seasons?
* How has the gender ratio of finalists changed over the seasons?
