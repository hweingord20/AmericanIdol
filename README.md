# EDAV Final Project: American Idol Analysis
## Anusha Nandula & Hailey Weingord

### Project Description

This project explores the factors that contribute to success on the reality TV show American Idol. Using [data](https://github.com/kkakey/American_Idol) from seasons 1-18, we analyzed trends to determine correlations with winners, finalists, and overall show performance. Our analysis includes dataset descriptions, exploratory data analysis (EDA), an interactive visualization, and a summary of key findings.
