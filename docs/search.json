    "text": "1 Introduction\nAmerican Idol is a reality TV show where aspiring singers compete for the winning title. Once the contestants go through the final round of auditions, the they perform in front of a panel of judges and a live audience. Overall, we want to analyze what factors are correlated with winners/finalists and what contributes to the success of the show. We decided on this topic because we both grew up watching American Idol and are interested in the statistics in the background. Through our data analysis, we will examine the following questions:\n\nAre certain song choices associated with a higher change of reaching the finals or winning?\nWhich audition cities produced the most finalists or winners across seasons?\nAre younger contestants more likely to be eliminated earlier or later in the competition?\nAre certain judges associated with higher-rated seasons?\nHow has the gender ratio of finalists changed over the seasons?",

Due to this, we decided to not use this specific dataset for our analysis and will tweak our questions accordingly. For example, we will rephrase the question: ‘Are younger contestants more likely to be eliminated earlier or later in the competition?’ to ‘What is the age distribution among the finalists?’. For the Audition datset, the column ‘guest_judge’ has the most missing values. This makes sense because there is not a guest judge on every episode. Interestingly, the finalists dataset is missing a lot of values. When further examining the dataset, we found it because there is a “hometown” and “birthplace” column. For those with the same hometown and birthplace, hometown is left as NA. For this reason, we will take out the ‘hometown’ column and just use the ‘birthplace’ column. The ratings dataset has a lot of missing values as well, but we don’t need to use these columns for the questions we are interested in answering.",
